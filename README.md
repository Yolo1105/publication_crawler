# Web Scraper with Proxy Support

This project is a sophisticated web scraper designed to fetch search results from a specified website using a robust proxy rotation mechanism. It is built using Python and leverages powerful libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `concurrent.futures`, and `fake_useragent` to perform efficient and stealthy web scraping.

## Features

- Automatically scrapes and validates proxies from free proxy listing websites.
- Implements intelligent proxy rotation to minimize the risk of IP blocking.
- Employs multi-threading to enhance scraping efficiency.
- Detailed logging of activities and errors, with logs saved in date-based filenames.
- Supports resuming scraping tasks from the last saved checkpoint.
- Outputs scraped data into a well-structured CSV file.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

### Required Packages

First, install the necessary Python packages using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Contents of `requirements.txt`:**

```plaintext
requests
beautifulsoup4
fake_useragent
tqdm
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraper-with-proxy-support.git
cd web-scraper-with-proxy-support
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Script

To start the scraper:

```sh
python scraper.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to resume from a previously saved page or initiate a new search.

### Anti-Detection Strategies

This scraper employs several strategies to mimic human browsing behavior and avoid detection:

- **Proxy Rotation:** The scraper accesses a frequently updated list of free proxies and tests each for reliability. Only functional proxies are used for requests.
  
- **Random User-Agents:** By using the `fake_useragent` library, the script generates diverse user-agent strings, making each request appear as if it comes from a different browser and device.

- **Adaptive Request Timing:** To further reduce the risk of detection, the scraper variably adjusts the timing between requests, simulating natural browsing speed.

### Data Crawling Process

1. **Scraping Proxies:** Proxies are scraped from `https://www.sslproxies.org/`, checking each for functionality.

2. **Fetching and Parsing Results:** Using valid proxies, the script constructs queries, fetches search results, and parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. This allows for the extraction of precise information, navigating through complex page structures.

### Introduction to BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is a crucial library for web scraping in Python, providing tools to parse HTML and XML documents easily. It allows for efficient searching and modification of the parse tree, making it possible to extract data from poorly formatted HTML.

### Data Management

- **CSV Storage:** Extracted data is systematically stored in CSV files, enabling easy analysis and processing.
  
- **Progress Tracking:** The script can save its current state to a JSON file, allowing for interruption recovery.

### Main Function

The `main()` function coordinates the entire scraping operation, managing proxy updates, user interactions, data retrieval, and storage.
