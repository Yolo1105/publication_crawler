# Web Scraper with Proxy Support

This sophisticated web scraper is designed to fetch search results from specified websites using a robust proxy rotation mechanism. Built using Python, it leverages powerful libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `concurrent.futures`, and `fake_useragent` to perform efficient and stealthy web scraping.

## Features

- Automatically scrapes and validates proxies from free proxy listing websites.
- Implements intelligent proxy rotation to minimize the risk of IP blocking.
- Employs multi-threading to enhance scraping efficiency.
- Detailed logging of activities and errors, with logs saved in date-based filenames.
- Supports resuming scraping tasks from the last saved checkpoint.
- Outputs scraped data into a well-structured CSV file.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

### Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Contents of `requirements.txt`:**

```plaintext
requests
beautifulsoup4
fake_useragent
tqdm
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraper-with-proxy-support.git
cd web-scraper-with-proxy-support
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Script

To start the scraper:

```sh
python scraper.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to resume from a previously saved page or initiate a new search.

### Anti-Detection Strategies

The scraper employs several strategies to avoid detection and simulate human browsing behavior:

- **Proxy Rotation:** Utilizes a frequently updated list of free proxies, testing each for functionality.
  
- **Random User-Agents:** Uses the `fake_useragent` library to generate diverse user-agent strings for each request.

- **Adaptive Request Timing:** Adjusts the timing between requests to mimic natural browsing speeds.

### Data Crawling Process

1. **Scraping Proxies:** Retrieves proxies from `https://www.sslproxies.org/`, validating each one for functionality.
2. **Fetching and Parsing Results:** Constructs queries, fetches search results, and parses HTML content using BeautifulSoup to navigate complex page structures and extract data.

### Introduction to BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is a crucial Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It simplifies web scraping by providing tools to navigate and search the parse tree easily. Key features include handling multiple parsers like lxml and html5lib, searching by tags, attributes, and text, and processing poorly formatted HTML.

### Data Management

- **CSV Storage:** Systematically stores extracted data in CSV files, facilitating easy analysis.
- **Progress Tracking:** Saves the current state to a JSON file, allowing the scraper to resume operations after interruptions.

### Main Function

The `main()` function orchestrates the entire scraping operation, managing proxy updates, user interactions, data retrieval, and storage. It is designed to manage fetching search results for specific queries and ensures seamless operation even after interruptions.

### Logging and Error Management

Detailed logging is configured to capture all operational activities. The logs are stored with date-based filenames, helping in troubleshooting and ensuring transparency in the scraping process.

### Proxy and User Agent Management

- **Proxy Management:** The script dynamically manages proxies by scraping, validating, and rotating them to maintain uninterrupted access and avoid detection.
- **User Agent Rotation:** Random user agents are generated for each request to mimic diverse browsing patterns.
